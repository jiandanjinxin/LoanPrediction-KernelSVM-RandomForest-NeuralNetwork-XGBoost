# LoanPrediction-KernelSVM-RandomForest-NeuralNetwork-XGBoost
Four models (SVM Kernel, XG Boost, Random-Forest and Neural Network) were applied over a data which supplies us information about the customers &amp; asks to predict whether loan should be given to them or not. Used K-Fold Cross Validation to avoid over-fitting and used Grid Search for tuning parameters.
